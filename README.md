# discord-bot
Basic discord bot with music and AI inside of it <br>
Nahida is just my discord bot's name :) 


## Getting Started

1. Open file named config.json, copy your token, client_id, guild_id.

  - The token, you can get from discord developer website in this link `https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro`, go to application and go to your bot get your token there.
  - The Client ID, you can get it from discord server and copy ID of your bot.
  - The Guild ID, you can get it from discord server and copy ID your server ID.

## How it Works?
I'm using `discord.js` and `discord-player` packages from npm and running it using node. <br>
The token it'll needed to authenticate your bot into discord API. Also client ID and guild ID is the identity of your bot user and server user. <br>
Actually, guild ID isn't necessary to adding it.
